# not-doodle-jump
follow our hero dat boi on his quest to reach the top of /r/me_irl. no bamboozle. me too thanks.

## Inspiration
Not Doodle Jump, that's for sure.
## What it does
It goes up. The numbers go up. It also goes sideways, to a certain extent. Very differently from the way Doodle Jump does.
## How I built it
Perseverance, sugar, and dank memes. And not Doodle Jump.
## Challenges I ran into
Doodle Jump kept trying to copy me. Also, I had never used Android Studio or built an Android app before yesterday.
## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
How very un-Doodle-Jump-esque this glorious creation is.
## What I learned
Literally everything I know about Android programming.
## What's next for the project
If we're being frank, probably nothing. I'm a busy dude. But it might be fun to fix it up a bit and slap it on the Play Store. Definitely wouldn't have any real competition. Especially not from Doodle Jump.
